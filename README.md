## Custom Commands
My personal collection of commands that I made for personalization of my linux environment

## How to install
Go into `./custom_commands` and run the `install.sh` program, **make sure to be running it as user, not as root**, or else only root will be able to run the commands as PATH commands


I only made this public because I still don't know how to `git clone` with my private repositories fast enough in my VM's
